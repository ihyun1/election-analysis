# election-analysis

## Project Overview
Seth and Tom, two employees of the Colorado Board of Elections, have to complete an election audio of a recent local congressional election. The audit should include the total number of votes, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. They sought to automate this process with python instead of utilizing Excel, and thus we have built a script to make this process more efficient and useful for other elections. 

## Resources
Data source: election_results.csv
Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.47.3

## Election Results
In the election, there were a total of 369,711 votes. These votes were cast for three different candidates, Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane.

Diana DeGette won the popular vote by a wide margin with 73.8% of the vote, 272,892 votes. Charles Casper Stockham was the runner up with 23.0% of the vote, 85,213 votes, and Raymon Anthony Doane came in last with 3.1% of the vote, 11,606 votes.
